Many AI projects never make it past the proof-of-concept stage. Why? Because real-world deployment comes with **hidden challenges** that companies underestimate.  

## The AI Deployment Gap  

### ðŸ”´ **Common Challenges**  
1. **Data Drift & Model Decay** â€“ AI models degrade over time without **continuous monitoring**.  
2. **Scalability Issues** â€“ Prototypes work in controlled environments, but real-world data is messy.  
3. **MLOps & Infrastructure** â€“ Most companies lack **end-to-end AI pipelines**.  

## How to Overcome Deployment Challenges  



## Final Thoughts  

AI deployment is **more than just training models**â€”it requires **scalable architecture, governance, and operational excellence**.
