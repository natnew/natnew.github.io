## Myth #1: AI Steals Your Data
**False. It’s not the AI stealing your data—it’s the platform hosting it.**

🔹 **The Truth:**
When you interact with an AI model like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, or Claude, the model itself doesn’t steal data. Instead, the company hosting it decides how to handle user inputs.

🔍 **Case in Point:**

- OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Perplexity all process prompts via servers, but their data policies differ.
- Open-weight models (like DeepSeek R1) allow users to run AI locally, ensuring privacy.
- API-based models (like OpenAI’s GPT-4) require trust in the host's data security policies.

💡 **Takeaway:**
The risk isn’t in using AI—it’s in who you trust to host it. Want full control? Use open-weight AI models that let you run AI on your own device.
